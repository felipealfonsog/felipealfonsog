### Hi there! 👋

<!-- 
> Strategic Systems Architect & Cyber Intelligence Engineer — building secure, high-impact open-source for mission-critical environments.

I'm [Felipe](https://github.com/felipealfonsog/felipealfonsog/wiki/Felipe-Alfonso-Gonz%C3%A1lez-L.), a [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) [Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer) ([Ingº](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeniero) en [Informática](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingenier%C3%ADa_inform%C3%A1tica)) from [Santiago, Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago), with expertise in [OSS Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development), [Systems Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture), [Software Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), [Cybersecurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersecurity), [Cyber Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence), [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), and [Cyber Counter-Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism), as well as in [R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development) ([I+D](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigaci%C3%B3n_y_desarrollo)). I am constantly involved in innovative endeavors while pursuing forthcoming postgraduate studies in innovation and technology, along with advanced courses and professional certifications. Beyond coding and technical work, I constantly explore new ideas, deepen my knowledge across diverse domains, and contribute as a maintainer in the [GitHub community](https://github.com/community). In my leisure, I enjoy reading, playing [bass guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar) (jazz/blues), practicing [Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) (BJJ), [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) (*Mindfulness*), and listening to music ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/12133266428)) - while cherishing a deep love for animals and nature, supporting [PETA](https://www.peta.org/) in ethical advocacy. As a former [Rover Scout Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_Scout) with the Agrupación Nacional de [Boy Scouts de Chile](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrupaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_de_Boy_Scouts_de_Chile), I uphold their mission and values. As I've previously expressed, I thoroughly enjoy writing and reading ([Goodreads](https://goodreads.com/felipealfonsog) Bookshelves); I'm always seeking enlightenment and knowledge — I seek truth in the silence of my steps; this is why I enjoy studying philosophy, consciousness, and even exploring the knowledge found in [Freemasonry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry) in all its forms. I value transparency and authenticity, believing that sharing ideals is meaningful, and I consider integrity a guiding principle reflecting commitment to truth and human dignity. Aligning my values with my work, I strive to act with coherence, purpose, and respect for the broader impact of my actions. If you harbor aspirations in business, entrepreneurship, consultancy, research, or collaboration, do not hesitate to reach out. Should you be in [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago), I would be delighted to engage in a thoughtful conversation over coffee ☕️ 💬 or online. You can find my contact information [here](https://github.com/felipealfonsog#how-to-reach-me), visit my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/felipealfonsog), my [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/felipealfonsog), at [felipe.gnlz.cl](https://felipe.gnlz.cl/) - [gnlz.cl](https://gnlz.cl/), [here](https://freeshell.de/~felipe/), my [Telegram](https://t.me/felipealfonsog) or just 📨 [email-me](mailto:felipe.alfonso.glz@gmail.com).  ⟁ ❀

UNIX-born engineering ethos.  
Forged through [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) kernel builds, console-only workflows, and learning through friction — not convenience.  
Deep experience across the [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) lineage: [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) and early [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS), back when it still carried the spirit of [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP).  
From [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) nights to early web stacks ([Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ColdFusion)), my mindset was built before [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), before shortcuts.  
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) remains my lab, my server backbone, and my home.

I still keep my 90s-era [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) book — [The “Camel Book”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Perl) (~1,000+ pages) — a reminder of long nights with coffee, dim light, and room-heating computers with painfully bad [CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) screens, when computers were heavy [tower cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case) — not millimeters-thin devices. That was my era: experimenting with [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) network cables in my bedroom, running multiple rigs, giving old hardware a second life with [Mandrake Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake_Linux). Later, I carried that obsession into engineering school.

Back in the early 2000s, I once served as the sysadmin for a small newspaper: the owner handed me cash, I bought the server in San Miguel, took a taxi to downtown Santiago, and walked through Calle Moneda in [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago) carrying that machine in my arms to a data center for installation. The network team allowed me to run [Mandrake Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandrake_Linux) on it — and I maintained the whole thing myself via [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell): [Apache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server), ops, uptime, and survival. Before [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) existed, I built the newspaper platform too — including threaded discussions in the publications, mixing [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) with [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) and other early-web craftsmanship. In those early 2000s days, I come from the old school: moving files with [SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol) between machines, running [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) in pure terminal (no GUI) — just `psql`, logs, and uptime.

I still remember nights in [Santiago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago) working inside the [Palacio de La Moneda](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_de_la_Moneda), learning Postgres from my mentor, [Dario Riquelme Zornow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dario-riquelme-zornow/), in a server hall until 5 AM — walls of terminals, live data, [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) everywhere, [Fluxbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbox) on the desktop. That was my training ground. In that same era, [Smith Saavedra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smith-saavedra/) and [Mauricio Alberto Robles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrobles/) were also incredible mentors. I’m still grateful for that mentorship. That era, those mentors — that’s where my engineering was forged.

Some of my earliest engineering memories are [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) nights, [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) sessions, and multi-user [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) systems — learning by building, breaking, and fixing.

Forged through [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) the hard way: compiling [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel), hacking [connectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet), and learning through friction — not convenience.  
Rooted in the [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) lineage: heavy [FreeBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD) years, and early [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) back when it still carried the spirit of [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP).  
From [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) nights with a book on my lap to early web stacks ([Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ColdFusion)), my engineering mindset was forged before [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), before shortcuts.

<summary>▮ Strategic Cyber Intelligence & Counter-Terrorism Operations — <i>Restricted</i></summary>

<br>

My work spans the analysis of hostile digital infrastructures, the profiling of adversarial behavior, and the identification of coordinated threat patterns that intersect with national-level cyber operations.

I focus on dissecting advanced intrusion chains, mapping threat actor ecosystems, and evaluating high-risk signals that emerge within hybrid digital-physical environments — including those relevant to counter-terrorism intelligence.

**Operational areas of involvement include:**  
- Adversary behavioral analysis & TTP correlation  
- Infrastructure tracking across multi-layered threat surfaces  
- Early-phase detection of coordinated digital aggression  
- High-risk intelligence assessment in cross-domain scenarios  
- Strategic modeling of threat actor capabilities & intent  

Due to the nature of this domain, all operational specifics, methodologies, and classified tooling remain deliberately omitted.

  > "You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference." ~ [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) [Stanford commencement speech, June 2005] 

  > "In a cold and ruthless world, all that remains is to thole, persevere and withstand, hold back the tears, and remember that we are nothing more than a whisper in the vastness, an echo that will fade. Nothing of what we possess, nothing of what we believe ourselves to be, will endure… except that which, in the intimacy of ritual and introspection, we forge within ourselves. And not even that. Still, in the deepest darkness, we must learn to rise with an unbreakable will, for only in that acceptance —in that descent to the threshold of the void, where the soul faces its own shadow— can we carve our consciousness into something higher, more worthy… something that transcends." ~ [Felipe Alfonso González L.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Felipealfonsog)

<summary>📚 Explore further insights about me here...</summary> 
  <br>
I am a Computer Science Engineer (Ingº en Informática) with deep expertise in Systems Architecture, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Cyber Intelligence, and Counter-Terrorism. I am continuously engaged in advanced academic pursuits through postgraduate programs, specialized diplomas, and cutting-edge courses. My focus is on R&D (I+D), specializing in Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and other transformative areas that drive the evolution of computer science. I possess a formidable skill set in coding—primarily in the open-source ecosystem—statistics, data research and engineering, and cybersecurity, which I leverage to develop innovative, high-impact solutions using state-of-the-art technologies.

I have been immersed in technology since the mid-90s, when connecting to the internet required a phone cable and compiling the Kernel on UNIX or GNU/Linux. Passionate about FreeBSD, Debian, and Arch, I collaborated with brilliant engineers of that era, which fueled my drive for innovation and entrepreneurship, and allowed me to share insights with Chilean entrepreneur Leo Prieto.

With decades of experience in technology, I continually advance my expertise in areas such as mathematics (including algebra and calculus), data structures, databases, software engineering, functional and object-oriented programming, advanced algorithms, dynamic and stochastic modeling, non-compensatory decision models, data science, and code refactoring and decomposition. I apply this deep knowledge through engineering, research, and consulting to develop high-impact, innovative solutions.

Throughout my life, I have lived and worked in New Delhi, India; Auckland and Christchurch in New Zealand; California, US; and Cape Town, South Africa. These international experiences have endowed me with fluency in English and Afrikaans, in addition to my native Spanish, and have cultivated a deep adaptability to diverse cultural and professional environments. You are welcome to connect with me in any of these languages.

If you are interested in starting a business, consulting, research, or collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/felipealfonsog) or [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/felipealfonsog). If you happen to be in Santiago—or online anywhere in the world—we could also meet over a cup of coffee or a virtual chat; just let me know in advance, as I may be engaged in exciting projects. Thank you!

  <summary>📝 In brief, let me provide you with some additional details about myself...</summary>
<br>
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about Unix/Linux flavors, as I have a deep passion for Linux/Unix-based systems like the adorable penguin mascot of GNU/Linux 🐧 and macOS, which is UNIX/BSD-based and deserves a special mention with the  symbol and the badges for Linux & macOS below! I'm also knowledgeable about various topics in science and technology. From general inquiries to specific subjects, I'm here to help. Additionally, I can provide insights into entrepreneurship, management, teaching, writing papers, and conducting research. And, of course, I'm well-versed in computer science engineering as a whole. So, go ahead and ask me anything you'd like! 😄
